# Producer Following Feature Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of the producer following feature for MyBeatFi.io, which allows clients to follow producers and receive email notifications when they upload new tracks.

## Overview

The feature includes:
1. **Database tables and functions** for managing producer follows
2. **UI components** for following/unfollowing producers
3. **Email notification system** for new track uploads
4. **Dashboard integration** for managing followed producers

## Database Implementation

### 1. Create Producer Follows System

Run the SQL file `create_producer_follows_system.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This creates:
-- - producer_follows table
-- - Database functions for managing follows
-- - RLS policies for security
-- - Indexes for performance
```

### 2. Create Track Notification Queue

Run the SQL file `create_track_notification_trigger.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This creates:
-- - track_notification_queue table
-- - Database triggers for track uploads
-- - Functions for processing notifications
```

## Edge Functions

### 1. Send Producer Track Notification

Deploy the Edge Function `supabase/functions/send-producer-track-notification/index.ts`:

```bash
supabase functions deploy send-producer-track-notification
```

This function sends email notifications to followers when a producer uploads a new track.

### 2. Process Track Notifications

Deploy the Edge Function `supabase/functions/process-track-notifications/index.ts`:

```bash
supabase functions deploy process-track-notifications
```

This function processes the notification queue and sends emails in batches.

## Frontend Components

### 1. ProducerFollowButton Component

Location: `src/components/ProducerFollowButton.tsx`

This component provides:
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Email notification preferences
- Confirmation dialog for email notifications
- Visual feedback for follow status

### 2. Following Component (Dashboard)

Location: `src/components/Following.tsx`

This component shows:
- Summary of followed producers in the dashboard
- Quick access to producer profiles
- Link to full following management page

### 3. FollowingPage Component

Location: `src/components/FollowingPage.tsx`

This component provides:
- Full management of followed producers
- Toggle email notifications
- Unfollow functionality
- Producer profile links

## Integration Points

### 1. Producer Profile Dialog

Updated `src/components/ProducerProfileDialog.tsx` to include the follow button:

```tsx
import { ProducerFollowButton } from './ProducerFollowButton';

// Added to the producer info section
<ProducerFollowButton
  producerId={producerId}
  producerName={`${profile.first_name} ${profile.last_name}`.trim() || 'Producer'}
/>
```

### 2. Client Dashboard

Updated `src/components/ClientDashboard.tsx` to include the Following component:

```tsx
import { Following } from './Following';

// Added after FavoritedPlaylists component
<Following />
```

### 3. App Routing

Added route for the Following page in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { FollowingPage } from './components/FollowingPage';

// Added route
<Route path="/following" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <LayoutWrapper>
      <FollowingPage />
    </LayoutWrapper>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## Email Notification System

### Email Template Features

The email notifications include:
- **Catchy subject lines** with emojis and track titles
- **Professional HTML design** matching MyBeatFi branding
- **Track details** (genre, BPM, key, duration)
- **Producer information** with company name
- **Direct link** to the track page
- **Unsubscribe link** to manage preferences

### Email Content

The emails are sent from `notifications@mybeatfi.com` and include:
- MyBeatFi logo and branding
- Track information and metadata
- Producer details
- Call-to-action button to listen and license
- Footer with unsubscribe information

## User Flow

### 1. Following a Producer

1. Client clicks "Follow Producer" button in producer profile
2. Confirmation dialog asks about email notifications
3. Client chooses "Yes, notify me" or "No, just follow"
4. Follow relationship is created in database
5. Button updates to show "Unfollow" and notification status

### 2. Receiving Notifications

1. Producer uploads a new track
2. Database trigger adds entry to notification queue
3. Edge Function processes queue and sends emails
4. Followers with notifications enabled receive emails
5. Emails include track details and direct links

### 3. Managing Follows

1. Client visits `/following` page
2. Views all followed producers
3. Toggles email notifications per producer
4. Unfollows producers as needed
5. Accesses producer profiles and tracks

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- Users can only view and manage their own follows
- Producers can view their followers list
- Service role can access notification queue

### Data Validation

- Only clients can follow producers
- Unique follow relationships prevent duplicates
- Email notification preferences are stored per relationship

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

- Indexes on `follower_id`, `producer_id`, `followed_at`
- Indexes on notification queue for processing
- Optimized queries for dashboard display

### Email Batching

- Notification queue processes in batches of 10
- Rate limiting prevents email spam
- Failed emails are logged for debugging

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Follow Functionality**

## Deployment Steps

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   # 1. create_producer_follows_system.sql
   # 2. create_track_notification_trigger.sql
   ```

3. **Frontend Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy updated React components
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting platform
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Ensure these are set in Supabase:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` for email sending
   - `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for Edge Functions

## Monitoring

### Email Logs

Monitor the `email_logs` table for:
- Successful email sends
- Failed email attempts
- Email delivery rates

### Notification Queue

Monitor the `track_notification_queue` table for:
- Queue processing status
- Failed notifications
- Processing times

## Future Enhancements
