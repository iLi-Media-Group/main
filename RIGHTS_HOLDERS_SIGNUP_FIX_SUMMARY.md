### 2. üîß **RLS Policy Conflicts** - FIXED

### 3. üîç **422/406 Database Errors** - DIAGNOSING

- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling in `RightsHolderAuthContext.tsx`
- **Status**: üîç Needs database fix application

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### Step 1: Apply Database Fixes ‚úÖ READY
Run the `fix_existing_rights_holders_system.sql` script in Supabase SQL editor:
- Drops and recreates RLS policies to fix permission issues
- Ensures RLS is enabled on both tables
- Creates missing indexes and triggers
- Verifies the fix worked

### Step 2: Test Database Connection ‚úÖ READY
Run the `test_rights_holder_signup.sql` script to verify:
- Table structure is correct
- RLS policies are working
- Data validation constraints are in place
- Foreign key relationships are correct

### Step 3: Test Signup Process ‚úÖ READY
After applying the database fixes:
1. Try signing up a new record label account
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify the user is created and redirected to dashboard

## Enhanced Error Handling

I've updated the `RightsHolderAuthContext.tsx` to provide better error messages:

- **Table Not Found (42P01)**: "Database tables not found. Please contact support to set up the rights holders system."
- **Permission Denied (42501)**: "Permission denied. Please contact support to configure database permissions."
- **General Errors**: Detailed logging for debugging

## Expected Results After Fix

1. **Signup**: Should complete successfully without 422 errors
2. **Database Queries**: Should return data without 406 errors  
3. **User Creation**: Should create both auth user and rights holder record
4. **Dashboard Access**: Should redirect to rights holder dashboard

## Troubleshooting Commands

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Check Database Status**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rights_holders;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rights_holder_profiles;
   ```

2. **Verify RLS Policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'rights_holders';
   ```

3. **Test User Permissions**:
   ```sql
   SELECT auth.uid() as current_user_id;
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database fix script** (`fix_existing_rights_holders_system.sql`)
2. **Test the signup process** with a new account
3. **Monitor browser console** for any remaining errors
4. **Verify dashboard access** after successful signup

## Files Created/Modified
