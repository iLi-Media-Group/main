-- Ensure Robust Balance Calculation System for All Producers
-- This script ensures the system works correctly for all producers with proper error handling

-- 1. First, let's ensure all producers have balance records
INSERT INTO producer_balances (balance_producer_id, pending_balance, available_balance, lifetime_earnings, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT 
    p.id,
    0, -- pending_balance
    0, -- available_balance
    0, -- lifetime_earnings
    NOW(),
    NOW()
FROM profiles p
WHERE p.account_type IN ('producer', 'admin') OR p.account_type LIKE '%producer%' OR p.account_type LIKE '%admin%'
  AND p.id NOT IN (SELECT balance_producer_id FROM producer_balances)
ON CONFLICT (balance_producer_id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Verify all producers now have balance records
SELECT 
    'Balance Record Coverage' as section,
    COUNT(*) as total_producers,
    COUNT(pb.balance_producer_id) as producers_with_balance_records,
    (COUNT(*) - COUNT(pb.balance_producer_id)) as producers_missing_balance_records
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN producer_balances pb ON pb.balance_producer_id = p.id
WHERE p.account_type = 'producer';

-- 3. Show any producers still missing balance records
SELECT 
    'Producers Missing Balance Records' as section,
    p.email,
    p.id as producer_id,
    p.account_type
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN producer_balances pb ON pb.balance_producer_id = p.id
WHERE p.account_type = 'producer'
  AND pb.balance_producer_id IS NULL;

-- 4. Enhanced recalculate function that handles edge cases
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_pending_balance_robust(producer_id UUID)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
    calculated_pending_balance NUMERIC := 0;
    current_month_start DATE;
    current_month_end DATE;
BEGIN
    -- Set current month boundaries
    current_month_start := DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);
    current_month_end := current_month_start + INTERVAL '1 month';
    
    -- Calculate pending balance for current month only
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(pt.amount), 0)
    INTO calculated_pending_balance
    FROM producer_transactions pt
    WHERE pt.transaction_producer_id = producer_id
      AND pt.type = 'sale'
      AND pt.status = 'pending'
      AND pt.created_at >= current_month_start
      AND pt.created_at < current_month_end;
    
    -- Update the balance record
    UPDATE producer_balances 
    SET 
        pending_balance = calculated_pending_balance,
        updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE balance_producer_id = producer_id;
    
    -- Return the calculated value for verification
    RETURN calculated_pending_balance;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- 5. Enhanced function to recalculate all producer balances
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_all_pending_balances_robust()
RETURNS TABLE(producer_email TEXT, producer_id UUID, old_pending_balance NUMERIC, new_pending_balance NUMERIC, status TEXT) AS $$
DECLARE
    producer_record RECORD;
    old_balance NUMERIC;
    new_balance NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through all producers
    FOR producer_record IN 
        SELECT p.id, p.email
        FROM profiles p
        WHERE p.account_type = 'producer'
    LOOP
        -- Get current balance
        SELECT COALESCE(pb.pending_balance, 0)
        INTO old_balance
        FROM producer_balances pb
        WHERE pb.balance_producer_id = producer_record.id;
        
        -- Recalculate balance
        SELECT recalculate_pending_balance_robust(producer_record.id)
        INTO new_balance;
        
        -- Return result
        producer_email := producer_record.email;
        producer_id := producer_record.id;
        old_pending_balance := old_balance;
        new_pending_balance := new_balance;
        
        IF old_balance = new_balance THEN
            status := '✅ No Change';
        ELSE
            status := '🔄 Updated';
        END IF;
        
        RETURN NEXT;
    END LOOP;
