# Producer Signup Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary
The producer signup process was failing with the error "Failed to get producer details" even though the invitation code was valid and existed in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** that were blocking access to the `producer_invitations` table during the validation process. The validation function couldn't read the invitation data to verify the code, even though the invitation existed and was valid.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. RLS Policies
- **Problem**: RLS policies were too restrictive and blocked read access for validation
- **Solution**: Created a new policy `"Allow public read for validation"` that allows anonymous and authenticated users to read invitation data for validation purposes
- **Security**: Maintained admin-only write access while allowing necessary read access

### 2. Validation Function
- **Problem**: The `validate_producer_invitation` function had logic issues and couldn't access the data due to RLS
- **Solution**: Fixed the function with proper parameter references and added expiration check
- **Result**: Function now correctly validates invitation codes

### 3. Permissions
- **Problem**: Missing execute permissions on the validation function
- **Solution**: Granted execute permissions to both anonymous and authenticated users

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - The producer signup process should now work correctly

## For the Producer (Alex Davis)
- **Invitation Code**: `5oe1nuc4eabkferzhlkferzhlkfnk`
- **Email**: mrsolowkeybeats@gmail.com
- **Producer Number**: mbfpr-003
- **Status**: Valid and ready to use

## Next Steps for the Producer
1. **Try the signup process again** using the same invitation code
2. **Use the exact email**: mrsolowkeybeats@gmail.com
3. **Fill in all required fields**:
   - IPI Number (required for producers)
   - Performing Rights Organization (required for producers)
4. **Complete the signup** - it should now work without the "Failed to get producer details" error

## Testing Results
- ✅ Invitation exists and is valid
- ✅ RLS policies allow validation
- ✅ Validation function returns correct results
- ✅ Producer number can be retrieved successfully

## Security Notes
- RLS remains enabled for security
- Only read access is granted for validation
- Admin access is still restricted to admin users
- Service role access is maintained for backend operations

The fix maintains security while allowing the producer signup process to work as intended.
